/**
 * For getting a better understanding of State,
 * we should first understand - What is a State?
 * Ans: Any value that changes over time is a state.
 *
 * Now, we need to understand - What causes the state to update?
 * In Android apps, **State** is updated in response to **Events**.
 *
 * Events are inputs generated from outside or inside an application, such as:
 * - The user interacting with the UI by, for example, pressing a button.
 * - Other factors, such as sensors sending a new value, or network responses.
 *
 * **NOTE**:
 * While the state of the app offers a description of what to display in the UI,
 * events are the mechanism through which the state changes, resulting in changes to the UI.
 *
 * To understand the core UI update loop cycle, take a look at:
 * https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/jetpack-compose-state/img/f415ca9336d83142_856.png
 *
 * If a state change happens, Compose re-executes the affected composable functions
 * with the new state, creating an updated UIâ€”this is called recomposition.
 * Compose also looks at what data an individual composable needs,
 * so that it only recomposes components whose data has changed and
 * skips those that are not affected.
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 * Use Compose's **State** and **MutableState** types to make state observable by Compose.
 *
 * Compose keeps track of each composable that reads State value properties and
 * triggers a recomposition when its value changes. You can use the **mutableStateOf** function
 * to create an observable MutableState.
 *
 * It receives an initial value as a parameter that is wrapped in a State object,
 * which then makes its value observable.
